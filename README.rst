Changelog
=========

1.11.0 (2020-25-08)
-------------------

New
~~~

- Addapt pytest source to latest pytest.
  Starting on pytest 4.6.7 adds a <testsuites> root element.
  Also, "skips" was changed to "skipped" on newer pytest, support both options.


1.10.0 (2019-09-10)
-------------------

New
~~~

- New Data Splitter Sink.

  The new DataSplitterSink allows users to extract branches of the data tree
  and dynamically create files with that data using other parts of the data
  tree as ID.

  Check the `documentation <https://docs.kuralabs.io/flowbber/sinks.html#data-splitter-sink>`_
  for more information.

- Adds new field ``total_errors`` to Valgrind sources.

  Now the Valgrind XML sources will have a new field called ``total_errors``.
  The idea of this field is to have a count of the amount of errors that
  occurred. Users won't need to calculate the length of the errors list
  manually.

- Allow to save the journal in a specific location.

  The journal is a JSON file that reports all details about the execution of
  the pipeline including how many times the pipeline was run, when, which
  components passed or failed, among others.

  The journal was a debug tool but now its user consumable. To accommodate this
  the format of the journal changed to have more information.

  To save the journal issue the flag ``--journal myjournal.json``.

  See ``examples/journal/journal.json`` for an example.


1.9.0 (2019-08-12)
------------------

New
~~~

- Add option to Mongo sink to allow key overwrite.

  This allows a pipeline to override an entry in the database using the same
  key.

  .. code-block:: toml

     [sinks.config]
     overwrite = true

- Add type parsing in env source.

  A type can be specified for each environment variable, so that it is parsed
  and collected with the expected datatype. Types available are:

  :integer: Using Python's ``int()`` function.
  :float: Using Python's ``float()`` function.
  :string: Using Python's ``str()`` function.
  :auto: Using Flowbber's ``flowbber.utils.types.autocast``.
  :boolean: Using Flowbber's ``flowbber.utils.types.booleanize``.
  :iso8601: Using Flowbber's ``flowbber.utils.iso8601.iso8601_to_datetime``.

  Usage:

  .. code-block:: toml

     [sources.config]
     include = [
         "TESTENV_INT",
     ]

     [sources.config.types]
     TESTENV_INT = "integer"

- Pipelines can now be defined in YAML format.

  For example:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     sources:
       - type: timestamp
         id: timestamp
         config:
           epochf: true
           iso8601: true
           strftime: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'

Fixes
~~~~~

- Use which genhtml to find executable on lcov_html sink.

  This fixes an issue where the executable could not be found if a custom
  ``PATH`` was used.


1.8.0 (2019-07-12)
------------------

New
~~~

- The gtest source now supports XML files generated by gtest 1.8.1+.
- New ``include_files`` and ``exclude_files`` options in many Sinks and Sources.
  See `FilterSink Options <https://docs.kuralabs.io/flowbber/flowbber/flowbber.components.sink.html#filter-sink-options>`_
  for more information.
- New ``compress`` option added to the archive sink allow to create compressed ZIP archives.
- New ``extract`` option added to the JSON source allow to load JSON files from ZIP archives.
- The ``--extract`` and ``--derive-func-data`` options are now available to use on the LCOV source.

- Updated schemas to use Cerberus >=1.3.1 definition.


1.7.0 (2019-03-22)
------------------

New
~~~

- New ``--dry-run`` flag allows to parse, load, validate and build a pipeline
  without executing it.

Changes
~~~~~~~

- Improved logging when trying to instance a component to help debugging a
  pipeline that went wrong.
- Improved logging to show a log in higher level when things go bad.

Fixes
~~~~~

- Fix for missing plugin entries in documentation.
- Fix for documentation issue #27.


1.6.0 (2019-03-12)
------------------

New
~~~

- New LCOV merger aggregator allows to sum multiple LCOV sources.

Fixes

------------------

Changes
~~~~~~~

- lcov source no longer accepts ``directory`` as configuration.
  New option ``source`` superseded it, and allows to specify a directory to
  generate a tracefile or load one already generated.


1.4.0 (2019-01-28)
------------------

New
~~~

- Refactored Valgrind source to support loading data from Helgrind and DRD
  tools.
- New "Expander" aggregator that allows to move subdata to top level. This is
  useful to load data using JSONSource or similar sources and place it in the
  top level as if it were data from other anonymous sources. Or to replay
  a pipeline using previously collected data.

  to be overridden by the other:
